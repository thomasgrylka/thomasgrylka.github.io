                    Twitterâ€™s Expansion
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    Twitter endures as one of the central social media platforms used by
                    consumers today. It has evolved since its public release in July 2006. Its
                    deliverance came shortly after Facebook on February 4, 2004 (<a href="https://interestingengineering.com/a-chronological-history-of-social-media">McFadden,
                        2018</a>; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia">Phillips, 2007</a>). This synchronous release promoted its rapid growth.
                    The year 2006 was a booming era for all social media platforms. Twitter's
                    rapid growth ended the userbase of platforms like Myspace (<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/09/03/will-twitter-inc-become-the-next-facebook-inc-or-m.aspx">Bylund, Kline,
                        & Dumortier, 2015</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twitter shares user connectivity and communication with Facebook, but it is
                    not identical. It is novel because of its limited posts of 140 characters.
                    This limitation changed to 280 characters in early November 2017 (<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/tweetingmadeeasier.html">Rosen,
                        2017</a>) and arose from Twitter's SMS compatibility. At its time of release,
                    one of its most attractive innovations was the ability for users to text
                    their Tweets. Carriers limited texts to 160 characters at the time -
                    resulting in a 140-character limit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twitter saw 400,000 tweets per quarter in 2007. This massive figure
                    increased to 100 million tweets per quarter in 2008, and then 50 million
                    tweets daily in 2010 (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/7297541/Twitter-users-send-50-million-tweets-per-day.html">Beaumont, 2010</a>). In 2012, Twitter had 140 million
                    active users posting 340 million tweets per quarter. In 2018, these numbers
                    grew to 326 million active users posting a total of 500 million tweets
                    daily (<a href="https://www.omnicoreagency/">Aslam, 2019</a>; <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/10/26/twitter-overcounted-active-users-since-2014-shares-surge/801968001/">Molino, 2017</a>; <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-reach-1-million-followers-on-twitter">Twitter, 2012</a>). Users access Twitter on
                    the world wide web, mobile phone applications, and SMS text messages. Its
                    availability is one primary reason for its pervasive popularity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other factors must face reflection to form a working model of Twitter's
                    fanbase. Foremost is the capability of users to grow a following. Twitter
                    users adore this, and Twitter embraces it. It proffers them a private
                    perception of value, respect, and love (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2011.09.001">Westerman, Spence, & Heide,
                        2012</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Twitter offers global conversation at the click of a button.
                    Twitter's homogeneity and simplicity allot this transcendent advantage.
                    With an email, anyone can generate a Twitter handle for themselves or their
                    business. This convenience allows for companies, corporations, and groups
                    to interact with consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twitter is an invaluable platform for business preferment. It affords a
                    marketing medium for engaged clients, and it empowers communication with
                    customers in a familiar and welcoming way. It concedes popularity swelling
                    with followers and retweets. This conversation is vital for adequate patron
                    provisioning and engagement (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a59f/46c2ee905fabc79885189c1c6781def6e45b.pdf">Culnan, McHugh, & Zubillaga, 2010</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, it gained acclaim because of its celebrity association. The
                    entertainment enterprise has unceasingly retained global public attention.
                    This platform authorizes users to follow their beloved performers, actors,
                    and artists (<a href="http://www.journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/view/194">Muntean & Petersen, 2009</a>). Finally, the people could
                    mingle with the powerful and prosperous from the comfort of their own
                    homes. This openness encourages interaction and collaboration amidst
                    separate societies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two stellar models of fanbase augmentation exhibit Twitter's potential for
                    developing a following. In April 2014, Robert Downey Jr. posted a tweet
                    that earned him one million followers in 23 hours and 22 minutes (<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-reach-1-million-followers-on-twitter">Twitter,
                        2015</a>). Caitlyn Jenner promptly pulverized this Guinness world record in
                    2015. She drew one million followers in 4 hours and 3 minutes (<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-reach-1-million-followers-on-twitter">Twitter,
                        2015</a>) - an astonishing accomplishment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twitter additionally serves as a stage for political discourse. In 2016, it
                    was the leading provisioner of breaking news throughout the presidential
                    primaries (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/technology/for-election-day-chatter-twitter-ruled-social-media.html">Isaac & Ember, 2017</a>). People perpetually have it nearby.
                    This proximity conceives concise and expeditious newscasting. Twitter
                    fosters socialization and interaction among vastly distinctive characters
                    and clubs.
                </p>
                <h2>Is Twitter Bad?</h2>
                <p>
                    In Yves Smith's "Why Do I Hate Twitter," he parallels Twitter to Newspeak.
                    Newspeak is a notion from George Orwell's book "1984". Smith arraigns
                    Twitter's mission as one of domination and authority. They are comparable
                    because of their simplification of language (<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/02/twitter-communication-and-my.html">Smith, 2009</a>). Twitter limits
                    tweets to 140 characters. Like Newspeak, tweets render pure intent in their
                    words. The minute post breadth bequeaths little to no leeway for fluff or
                    filler. This constraint compels users to be concise and succinct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Smith matches Twitter to Newspeak by the application of emojis
                    and initialisms. Smith states these supersede customary and curvaceous
                    sentences. Smith declares Twitter generates a morphological and syntactical
                    deficiency in contemporaneous twitterers (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/twitterer">Webster, n.d.</a>). It has abated
                    their aptitude for excellent diction and compositional capacity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He regards these similarities to be precarious because of their coerced
                    constraints (<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/02/twitter-communication-and-my.html">Smith, 2009</a>). The character boundary bolsters loquacious
                    oppression. Smith alleges that it degrades the cognitive potential of its
                    users. It restricts their propensity to think freely, critically, and
                    creatively. Like Orwell's Newspeak, this is a method of censoring
                    communication. It narrows an individual's inclination to impede the
                    intentions of the prosperous and powerful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smith's piece is provocative, but criticism preponderates. Twitter is a
                    valuable terrace in people's private lives and the business world. It
                    enhances dialogue by conceding communications to the crowds. It is
                    accommodating and available worldwide. If the concept of a tweet nauseates
                    someone, all they should do is close their browser or their telephone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twitter can be pleasurable. Frequently, there are intellectual and lucid
                    discussions in attendance. A passionate contest is occurring on Twitter at
                    this very instant. Society must matriculate the supervision of themselves
                    and their enterprises. Humans govern their cognizance and must endeavor to
                    engage with it. A website cannot suffer culpability for the diminished
                    intellect of today's youth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People prefer to browse tweets or fragments of news rather than novels or
                    textbooks. The contemporaneous investigation has explicated tweets as
                    having a comparable, if not indistinguishable, influence on the mortal
                    mind. Twitter in no way hinders the expansion of mental acuity and
                    intrepidity (<a href="https://academyedstudies.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/normanreviewfinal.pdf">Bauerlein, 2001</a>). Twitter is what tweeters fashion from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The constitution of erudition communicated is far superior to its track of
                    transmission. One does not necessitate education in a singular style. To
                    learn of Satan's angelhood, one does need to study the New Testament; a
                    tweet will suffice, as long as the message is genuine and authentic -
                    elements regularly deficient in tweets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meghan M. Biro professes the various privileges of Twitter provisions. She
                    maintains her mindset in "Social Media Is Not the Death of Meaningful
                    Communication." She says Twitter enables people to meet each other. In
                    antiquity, these associations would doubtfully develop. Moreover, it allows
                    relationships a quicker construction. It facilitates constant and prompt
                    web communication (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2016/08/26/social-media-is-not-the-death-of-meaningful-communication/%22%20%5Cl%20%2254c74e504936">Biro, 2016</a>). This rapid relay relieves humans of the
                    obligation to corporally encounter one another. No longer do we require
                    proximity - an unbelievable modern technological phenomenon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biro progresses by maintaining that Twitter accommodates fast and friendly
                    connections. Humans migrate and relocate ceaselessly. In yore, this
                    annulled contact with friends or family (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2016/08/26/social-media-is-not-the-death-of-meaningful-communication/%22%20%5Cl%20%2254c74e504936">Biro, 2016</a>). Now, we can remain in
                    regular contact over the web. With the accelerated augmentation of human
                    expansion, many users view it as a sweeping endowment and benefaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smith imputes her dislike of Twitter on its character control. In Orwell's
                    Newspeak, language is limited and is diminishing (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/1984-George-Orwell/dp/1328869334">Orwell, 1949</a>). This
                    diminution is not the quandary with Twitter. The permissible character
                    quantity has since increased to 280 characters in November 2017. All these
                    speculations are what have delivered Twitter such substantial popularity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans are a social species. Our gift of communication is an ascendant and
                    unparalleled faculty - a gift magnified by the arrival of social media.
                    Research has yet to reveal any deleterious aspects of Twitter (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/03/21/the-surprising-truth-about-how-twitter-has-changed-your-brain/">Dewey,
                        2019</a>). Twitter is an open-source for learning, interacting, and networking.
                    It is currently unequaled by other recent technologies. Though Twitter's
                    swelling slowed in 2015, it still has over 300 million active users.
                    Twitter is one of the most attended localities on the world wide web. It
                    cannot be that bad.
